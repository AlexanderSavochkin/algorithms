# Algorithms

## Various algorithms implementations

This repository is a collection of algorithm implementations that I created while preparing for job interviews. The primary purpose was to refresh various algorithmic concepts.

Disclaimer: While these implementations may serve as a learning resource, I would not recommend using them directly in a production environment. The code here is designed for educational purposes, sometimes "quick-and-dirty", providing insights into algorithmic techniques rather than production-ready solutions.
