# Algorithms

## Various algorithms implementations

This repository contains a collection of algorithm implementations that I created while preparing for job interviews, reading books, or simply out of curiosity. The primary goal was to revisit various algorithmic concepts.

Disclaimer: While these implementations can serve as a valuable learning resource, I advise against using them directly in a production environment. The code here is designed for educational purposes and may sometimes be
considered "quick-and-dirty." It provides insights into algorithmic techniques rather than production-ready solutions.
